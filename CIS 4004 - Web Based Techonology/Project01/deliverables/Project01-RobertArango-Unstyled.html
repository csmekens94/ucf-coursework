            <h2>2015 Season Overview</h2>
        
            <p>The professional road season begins in mid-January in Australia (the Tour Down Under is currently underway) and by early February it moves to southern Europe and runs through late October with races all over the world. Events range from one-day classics to three-week grand tours. Some of the more famous races are the one-day classics of Paris-Roubaix in northern France, Tour de Flanders in the Belgian heartland, Milan-San Remo along western coast of Italy, and the grand tours of France, Italy, and Spain. Many people who are not cycling fans will have heard of the Tour de France, one of the largest sporting spectacles on earth.</p>
        
            <p>Professional cycling is governed by the Union Cyclist Internationale (<a href="http://www.uci.ch">UCI</a>) based in Aigle, Switzerland.</p>

                Arguably the biggest race of the year is the Tour de France which is held during July. Some riders specialize their riding style to do well in the grand tours, while other riders will specialize in the one-day classics and shorter stage races. The Tour de France typically has between 20 and 22 stages, usually one stage each day. The winner is determined by the lowest overall cumulative time over all stages. Stages include special stages run individually against the clock called time trials, but most stages are massed-start events with all riders covering the same course together. The Tour de France allows teams of 9 riders and typically between 18 and 22 teams are invited to compete in the event.

                Riders acquire UCI points throughout the year based upon their finishing position in the various races held around the world. The leader on points in any World Tour event wears a special jersey that signifies their leadership position. However, each year, the UCI also hosts the world championship event where the world champion is determined based on the winner of a single day event. For professional riders this event is normally around 150-165 miles long. This past year, Michal Kwiatkowski of Poland won the event to be crowned the 2014 World Champion. He will wear a special rainbow jersey until the world championship event late this year, where he will attempt to defend his title.

        <h2>Bikes of the Professionals</h2>

        <p>Professional riders use specific bikes for specific events. Time trial bikes being the most specialized with highly aerodynamic builds and disk wheels often used on the rear wheel. Bikes built for climbing are extremely lightweight while bikes built for sprinting or rougher roads are somewhat heavier. A standard professional bike weighs between 14 and 18 pounds. Today most bike frames are made from carbon fiber as are many of the components and wheels. Typical cost is between $6000 and $20,000 USD per bike. Some of the top bike builders are:</p>
